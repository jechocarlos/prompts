The AI's response(s) within that context
Evaluation Criteria
Evaluate the AI response based on the following criteria:

Context Retention:

Does the AI correctly remember and utilize information from earlier in the conversation?
Are references to previously established information handled appropriately?
Contextual Coherence:

Does the response maintain logical and thematic coherence with the ongoing conversation?
Are transitions between topics smooth and contextually appropriate?
Reference Resolution:

Does the AI correctly resolve pronouns, references, and callbacks to earlier content?
Are ambiguous references clarified or interpreted correctly?
Context Depth:

Does the AI maintain appropriate awareness of multiple contextual layers?
Is the conversation history utilized with proper weighting of recent vs. distant context?
