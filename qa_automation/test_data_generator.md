Based on this random seed {{$json.seed}}, generate test data for functionality testing asking questions based on provided topics, {{ $json.topics }} and schema. Ensure to generate {{ $json.numberOfTestData }} results.

Task

Create structured test data for each given topic that adheres to the input parameters schema, capturing the specific nature of data within each topic domain.

Requirements

Input Parameters Schema: Include all necessary fields, types, constraints, and relationships between parameters.
Data Nature: For each topic, identify and incorporate the intrinsic characteristics and properties that define the nature of data in that domain.

Steps:
1. Analyze the topics, {{ $json.topics }} to identify their specific data nature and generate key questions related to these topics.
2. Define the appropriate data patterns, formats, and ranges that represent the natural structure of each topic domain.
3. Use the input schema to generate valid test cases that reflect the authentic nature of each topic.
4. Ensure coverage of edge cases and boundary values within the context of each topic's natural data constraints.
5. Incorporate realistic variability in data to test robustness (e.g., random values within domain-specific constraints).

Output Format
Format: JSON containing the input parameters only with data that authentically represents the natural characteristics of each specified topic domain.
